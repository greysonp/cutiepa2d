# Cutiepa2D.js
Cutiepa2D (pronounced cutie-patootie) is a wrapper for CreateJS. Its purpose is to make developing 2D games in javascript dead simple. It extends CreateJS with additional functionality and structure while still allowing you to access all of CreateJS's existing utilities.

We think it's quite cute, and we hope you do too.
